# Argo CD RBAC & Projects

⏱️ _Estimated Time: 5 Minutes_

👨‍💻 _Role: Cluster Administrator and/or Developers_

Argo CD has a `default` project configured out of the box. You've been creating your Applications in this Project to manage the cluster-scoped resources you've created so far, but separate projects are recommended if you want to create structured teams and environments, and enforce RBAC for Argo CD users.

In this module you'll learn how to manage user groups in OpenShift, and how to manage projects and RBAC in Argo CD.

== Login to Argo CD as a Non-Admin User

So far you've been using the Argo CD `admin` user to interact with Argo CD. Try using logging in via OAuth as the `foo` user instead:

. Open a private browsing session.

[NOTE]
====
You can start a private browser session using *File > New Incognito Window* or *File > New Private Window*. It will vary depending on your web browser of choice. You could also use a different browser, i.e if you've been using Chrome so far, use Firefox to login as the `foo` user.
====
. Login to the OpenShift Web Console by following these steps:
    * Select the *standard-users* identity provider.
    * Enter the username: `foo`.
    * Enter the password: `foopassword`.
    * Click the *Log in* button.
. Expand the *Application Launcher* icon (3x3 sqaure) in the top-right of the OpenShift Web Console.

. Click the **Cluster Argo CD** link. This will open a new browser tab.
. Accept the self-signed certificate warning if one appears. The login page will now appear.
. Click the **Log in via OpenShift** button.
. Login using the same *standard-users* identity provider, the `foo` username, and the `foopassword` password you used previously when prompted.
. Click the *Allow selected permissions* button when prompted.

You should now be logged into the Argo CD dashboard as the `foo` user.

== Observing RBAC in Argo CD

Now that you've logged into Argo CD as the non-admin `foo` user, try to synchronise an Application:

. Click the *Sync* button on the *console-customisations* Application.
. Click the *Synchronize* button in the overlay that appears.

A permission denied error should appear in the bottom right corner of the screen. The text might be truncated, but it will look similar to this:

[source,plaintext]
----
Unable to deploy revision: permission denied: applications, sync, default/console-customisations
----

This error means that the current user does not have permission to perform the *sync* action on the *console-customisations* Application in the *default* Project.

Try using the *X* button on any of the Application tiles to delete them. A similar error will be returned, but instead it refers to the *delete* action:

[source,plaintext]
----
Unable to delete application: permission denied: applications, delete, default/console-customisations
----

In short, the `foo` user was automatically granted a `readonly` role. You can confirm this by using the *OpenShift Web Terminal* (in your other browser session as the `opentlc-mgr` user) to view the Argo CD RBAC configuration/policies defined in the `argocd-rbac-cm` ConfigMap:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc get cm argocd-rbac-cm -o yaml -n openshift-gitops
----

Notice that the default policy is specified as `policy.default: role:readonly` in the ConfigMap.

== Next Steps

Now that you've seen that Argo CD enforces RBAC, you'll need to create new Projects and grant OpenShift users access to them. This involves associating users in specific https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/rest_api/user_and_group_apis/group-user-openshift-io-v1.html[Groups, window=_blank] with policies defined in the Argo CD Project.

As you might have guessed, this requires defining some more YAML resources, and will be managed with another Argo CD application. You might be starting to think that it's tedious to set up each Application one-by-one. In the next section you'll learn how to use the https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/[App of Apps Pattern, window=_blank] to bootstrap your cluster with all of your Applications.

== Summary

In this section you learned that Argo CD enforces RBAC for Projects. This might seem trivial, but it's an important step in understanding how to manage your cluster and application resources.

In the next section you'll use the *App of Apps Pattern* to setup RBAC and Projects. This will enable your developers to leverage Argo CD to continuously deliver their applications!
