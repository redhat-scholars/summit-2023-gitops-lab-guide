# Argo CD Service Account Permissions

⏱️ _Estimated Time: 3 Minutes_

👨‍💻 _Role: Cluster Administrator_

Instead of carefully crafting a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to allow Argo CD to manage cluster-scoped resources, you'll save time in this workshop by simply granting the `cluster-admin` role to the Argo CD Service Account.

[NOTE]
====
The `cluster-admin` role is part of the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/authentication/using-rbac.html#default-roles_using-rbac[default cluster roles] included in OpenShift. Assigning the `cluster-admin` role to a user or Service Account provides it with super-user privileges.
====

== Grant Cluster-Admin Permissions to Argo CD's Service Account

. Login to the OpenShift Web Console.
. Open the Web Terminal using the **>_** icon in the top-right corner of the OpenShift Web Console.
. Use the OpenShift CLI to bind the _cluster-admin_ role to the Argo CD Service Account by executing the following command:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:openshift-gitops:openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
----
. Return to the Argo CD dashboard, and select the *managed-namespaces* Application.
. Manually trigger a sync by clicking the *Sync* button, accepting the default parameters, and clicking the *Synchronise* button. 

The Application will report *Healthy* and *Synced* status. This is because the Argo CD Service Account was able to synchronise all the resources this time, thanks to having `cluster-admin` privileges. 

[NOTE]
====
The `adm` subcommand provided by the OpenShift (`oc`) CLI is a utility that provides useful commands for OpenShift administrators. You can read more about it in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cli_reference/openshift_cli/administrator-cli-commands.html[OpenShift CLI administrator command reference, window=_blank].

== Verify Argo CD Synchronised Cluster-Scoped Resources

Argo CD should've synchronised the ResourceQuota resources now that the appropriate Service Account permissions are in place. You can verify this via the following steps:

. Login to the OpenShift Web Console.
. Open the Web Terminal using the **>_** icon in the top-right corner of the OpenShift Web Console.
. Run the following command to view the applied ResourceQuota for the `project-memes-prod` Namespace. The output should include a *Quota* section that has values that correspond to your patched ResourceQuota:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc describe project project-memes-prod
----
+
image::ex4.applied-quotas.png[]
. Do the same for the `project-memes-dev`. This should show a *Quota* with the values defined in the base ResourceQuota:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc describe project project-memes-dev
----

If the ResourceQuota is not reflected in the output, verify the sync status of the *managed-namespaces* in the Argo CD dashboard.
