# Summit 2023 - GitOps Workshop Guide

## Lab Environment Setup

### Using RHPD (demo.redhat.com)

This lab is designed to use environments provided by https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=gitops&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fsandboxes-gpte.ocp4-control-customize-apps.prod[this catalog item on demo.redhat.com]. Provision that catalog item with the workshop interface enabled, then direct your users to the instructions at https://redhat-scholars.github.io/summit-2023-gitops-lab-guide/[this link]!

### Using your own Environment

An Ansible role/task that performs much of the necessary setup can be found at https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/blob/development/ansible/roles_ocp_workloads/ocp4_workload_gitops_cluster_mgmt_workshop/tasks/workload.yml[this link].

. This is a single-tenant lab. Each lab attendee requires their own OpenShift cluster.
. The lab is tested with clusters running OpenShift 4.12, that have the stable channel of both the **Web Terminal** and **Red Hat OpenShift GitOps** operators installed in their default configurations.
. After installing the Web Terminal operator, edit the _DevWorkspaceTemplate_ resource named `web-terminal-tooling` in the `openshift-operators` Namespace to use the following image: `quay.io/evanshortiss/summit-2023-web-terminal-tooling:latest`.
. Lab attendees must have access to a user with `cluster-admin` permissions. In the instructions this is the `opentlc-mgr` that's provided by the `htpasswd` OAuth identity provider. You can read more about identity providers in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html[OpenShift Documentation]. 
. Lab users must have access to a `foo` user with no assigned permissions, and the password `foopassword`. In the lab instructions this is provided by the `standard-users` OAuth provider.

## Develop and Host the Lab Guide

This is only necessary if the hosted version available at https://redhat-scholars.github.io/summit-2023-gitops-lab-guide/[redhat-scholars.github.io/summit-2023-gitops-lab-guide] isn't accessible, or needs tweaks for your lab.

### Local Guide Development Build
